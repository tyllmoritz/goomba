Here is the entire source code to Goomba, based on Loopy's
PocketNES. You are free to do anything you want with it
(excluding the miniLZO library, which is distributed under the
GNU General Public License (GPL)).
I only ask that if you do use any of it in your own project, you
give me some credit for it.  This was compiled with ARM SDT 2.50.
