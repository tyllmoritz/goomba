This is a snapshot of me trying to convert Goomba Color to the GNU Assembler.

Contents:
src\source_conversion_tools:
	The hacky tools I made to convert much of the code's syntax
src\source_conversion_tools\labelkiller:
	Labelkiller - Takes in a list of labels, then for each "LDR, STR, ADR" line in the source code which refers to one of those labels, adds a underscore suffix.  This lets me kill off the register reletive labels by replacing them with macros like ldr_ str_ adr_.
src\source_conversion_tools\asmconv2:
	Asmconv2 - Tries to convert ARM SDT-formatted code to GNU-formatted code.  Conversion is not complete.
src\c:
	The C sources for goomba color, unchanged.  Not all code files are used.  (such as the dead-end development of speedhacks)
src\asm:
	The ASM source (ARM SDT) for Goomba Color.  Register Reletive labels were removed with almost no change in the binary.  Labelkiller works wonders.
src\asm\new:
	The output of asmconv2 run on the original source code.

Mainly of interest is the directory "src\asm\new".  It contains my futile attempts at converting the project.  Generated by a hackish source conversion automation tool I made.  Most of the syntax has been converted completely, but there are still lots of ARM SDT specific labels and directives in the code.

Right now, the error messages from the assembler are very unhelpful, especially considering it's CRASHING immediately after a macro is used!

So here's what needs to be done to convert it to GNU tools:
Fix the asm code, make it build correctly
Change the boot code
Make a linkscript
Make a makefile

And I have no clue how to do linkscripts and makefiles, I really need help.
